# Tool for Unique Lexicographically Identifier (ULID)

### [Original title] Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier

ULID is a widely used specification for identifiers which, 
unlike UUID, aims for readability, anonymity, compatibility, 
and practical use through sortability.
(Original specification: [https://github.com/ulid/spec](https://github.com/ulid/spec))

By modifying the original specification, this implementation enables 
the generation of guaranteed unique ULIDs within a file system.

> The ULID specification does not achieve guaranteed cross-system uniqueness. 
> Even the widely used UUID versions cannot achieve absolute uniqueness, 
> even though they are considered unique in practice. 
> [This project](https://github.com/UN8ID/UN8ID) 
> deals with the highest possible uniqueness in time and space with the highest possible anonymity.

## Statute

- This module implements the original specification and is extended 
  by modifications that follow the idea and properties.
- The module contains utils as separate modules/functions/methods 
  for the creation or handling of ULIDs.
- The module contains system integrity checks for the consistent creation of ULIDs.
- Python type checks during runtime are not performed.


## Properties and basic concept

### UUID vs ULID

#### Properties of a UUID

Depending on the version, a UUID can consist of
- **Timestamp**
- **The Mac address** 

  The use of a MAC address can be considered sensitive information about the creator that is being disclosed.

- **Random values**

  Random values can never be considered absolutely unique. Even though the probability of two identical UUIDv4s occurring is practically zero. Furthermore, random values naturally do not carry any information.

- **A centrally managed seed**

  A central, generally recognized authority is required.


#### Properties of a ULID

- 128-bit compatibility with UUID
- 1.21e+24 unique ULIDs per millisecond
- Lexicographically **sortable**
- Canonically encoded as a **26 character string**, as opposed to the 36 character UUID
- Uses **Crockford's base32** for better efficiency and readability (5 bits per character)
- **Case insensitive**
- No special characters (**URL safe**)
- **Monotonic sort order** (correctly detects and handles the same millisecond)



### Binary Layout (original specification)

A ULID has a fixed length of 128 bits coded in 16 bytes/octets and consists of
2 components. Each component is coded in big-endian
format (network byte order).

```
      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     |               |               |               |               |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | ms since epoch                                                |
     + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +-------------------------------+
     | ...                           | randomnes                     |

     | ...                                                           |
     + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Variations

_**ULID.runtime_lexical**_

Replaces the random part with a monotonic counter that counts up from 0 within a runtime and automatically restarts when the space is used up.
**Not thread-safe**.


_**ULID.local_lexical**_

Similar to runtime_lexical. Reads the last status of the counter from the file system and writes the status when the Python interpreter terminates.
**Not thread-safe**.


_**ULID.env_lexical**_

Here, the random part consists of 8 bits from a one-time read ID per interpreter start + 72 bits of a monotonic counter.
**Not sub-thread or sub-process safe.** However, for up to 256 simultaneously running main processes.


_**ULID.thread_env_lexical**_

Structured like env_lexical. Here, the thread ID is used for system-wide uniqueness.
**Thread-safe**.


_**ULID.short_env_lexical**_

Heavily modified version. The random part consists of only 8 bits. 
4 bits from a uniquely read ID per 
interpreter start + 4 bits from a monotonic counter.
**Not sub-thread or sub-process safe.** However, for up to 16 simultaneously running main processes.


## Module usages

```python
if bypass_checks:
    # By default, several system integrity checks are performed during import. 
    # To bypass this, the following code can be used
    import ulid_tool
    ulid_tool.SYSTEM_CHECKS = False
    from ulid_tool.ulid import ULID
else:
    from ulid_tool.ulid import ULID

# ULID of ORIGINAL SPECIFICATION
ulid = ULID()
